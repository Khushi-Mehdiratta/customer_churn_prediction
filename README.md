# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

##  Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical business problem where companies aim to identify customers who are likely to stop using their services.  
This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to predict customer churn based on historical customer data.

The goal is to help businesses take **data-driven retention decisions** by identifying high-risk customers in advance.

## Objectives
- Analyze customer behavior patterns
- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Train and compare multiple machine learning models
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
- Identify the best model for churn prediction

## Business Insights & Recommendations
Key Business Insights

Based on exploratory data analysis and model predictions, the following insights were observed:
Customers with shorter tenure show a significantly higher probability of churn, indicating weak early-stage engagement.
Higher monthly charges correlate strongly with churn, especially when not supported by value-added services.
Customers using basic service plans churn more frequently than those subscribed to bundled or premium services.
Payment method and contract type influence churn behavior — customers on flexible or short-term contracts are more likely to leave.
Ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost) captured non-linear patterns in customer behavior more effectively than baseline models.

Business Impact

Early identification of high-risk customers enables targeted retention campaigns
Reduces customer acquisition costs by improving retention
Helps businesses prioritize high-value customers for proactive engagement
Supports data-backed decision-making instead of reactive churn handling

Actionable Recommendations

Based on the model results, businesses can:
Design onboarding programs for new customers to reduce early churn
Offer personalized discounts or bundled plans for customers with high monthly charges
Introduce loyalty programs for customers completing key tenure milestones
Use churn probability scores to trigger automated retention alerts
Continuously retrain models with new data to adapt to changing customer behavior

Why This Matters for Stakeholders

Marketing Teams: Identify customers needing engagement campaigns
Sales Teams: Focus upselling efforts on churn-prone segments
Product Teams: Improve service offerings causing dissatisfaction
Management: Forecast churn trends and revenue risk

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be leveraged not just for prediction, but for strategic business decision-making.
By translating model outputs into actionable insights, organizations can move from reactive churn handling to proactive customer retention.
