# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical business problem where companies aim to identify customers who are likely to stop using their services.  
This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to predict customer churn based on historical customer data.

The goal is to help businesses take **data-driven retention decisions** by identifying high-risk customers in advance.
